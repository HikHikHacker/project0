# NOTE: SETS - Sets are different from lists and tuples in that they are unordered.
# They are also different because while you can have two or more of the same elements
# within a list/tuple, a set will only store each value once. We can define an empty set
# using the set function. We can then use add and remove to add and remove elements from
# that set, and the len function to find the setâ€™s size. Note that the len function works on
# all sequences in python. Also note that despite adding 4 and 3 to the set twice, each item
# can only appear once in a set.

#CREATE AN EMPTY SET

s = set()
